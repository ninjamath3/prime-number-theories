# Number Theory Python Tools

This repository contains personal Python scripts exploring various concepts in number theory. It serves primarily as a hosted collection of code on my GitHub profile.

## Overview

* Each file is named after the specific theory or idea it tests.
* Most scripts are designed for easy verification of number-theoretic properties such as primality, divisibility, and patterns in integers.
* One script is particularly notable: a Python library implementing functions for my most promising theory, which I have formally proved.

## Documentation

A complete PDF document is included in this repository, detailing the reasoning and proofs behind the theories explored. This allows anyone to understand the concepts and verify the results independently.

## Note

This project is primarily personal and educational. The code is hosted here to demonstrate my work in Python and number theory, and to provide a clear, structured overview of my experiments and findings.
